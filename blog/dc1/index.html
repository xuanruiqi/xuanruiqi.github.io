    <h2 class="title" id="intro">My JSPS DC1 application</h2>
</div>
<div class="justify-content-between align-items-center pt-3">
    <p>The results of 2022 JSPS DC1 fellowship applications just came out today. Unsurprisingly, I was not selected for the fellowship, but
on the bright side, my reviews were much better than what I had expected. I received a classification of &quot;A&quot; (which means I was in
the top 20% of all unsuccessful applicants), and my T-score (Tスコア) was 3.230, which means that I was ranked approximately
in the top 35% of all applicants.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h3 id="retrospection">Retrospection</h3>
<p>My proposed project was very much on the pure mathematics side of things, in terms of my research intersts. The official title of
my research proposal was &quot;様相型理論に基づく新しい数学基礎論及び代数幾何学への応用&quot; (&quot;A new foundation of mathematics based on modal
type theory and applications towards algebraic geometry&quot;). Broadly speaking, it is about the applications of modal HoTT and other modal
type theories towards mathematics, and especially towards algebraic geometry. Every modal type theory models a specific kind of topos
(for example, cohesive HoTT models cohesive toposes), and each topos corresponds to a kind of geometry. Therefore, using a topos theoretic &quot;bridge&quot;,
a type theory corresponds to a kind of geometry; one could even say that a type theory is exactly a geometry, interpreted in a synthetic way. This could
be used to develop geometry in a synthetic way, and could also facilitate computer-assisted reasoning, as well as computational applications. If you
are interested in the mathematics, I have posted my application <a href="/dc1.pdf">online</a> (I wrote my application in English).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, my research proposal did not receive a good enough score (3.17); it was passable, but not <em>good</em>. I guess several factors contributed
to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I classified my proposal as one about &quot;foundations of mathematics&quot; rather than &quot;algebra&quot; or &quot;geometry&quot;. In any case, it did not fit well into any category,
but retrospecting on my application, it seems that algebra or geometry would have been better classifications; the story I was telling probably just wasn't so
exciting to logicians;</li>
<li>I simply wasn't able to spend enough time on my proposal, being very busy about my thesis;</li>
<li>I probably should have consulted more with algebraic geometers and algebraic topologists.</li>
</ul>
<p>For DC2, I suppose writing a proposal leaning more towards computer science and the applied side of things would help, as this would help me play to my strengths.</p>
<p>The other part of my evaluation, &quot;qualities as a researcher&quot; went unexpectedly well (I received a rather high score of 4.0). I guess having publications and talks helped,
although they are not so directly connected to my proposal. I understand, however, that for DC2, more applicants would have had published papers, so the competition would
be even more fierce on this front.</p>
