Here are some expository mathematical notes I've written.

* [**An alternate proof for the convergence of $e^x$**](/Exponential.pdf): in these notes, I give a simple and very elementary proof of the
convergence of $e^x$. 
* [**Introduction to topological K-theory**](/Ktheory.pdf): an expository article I wrote for a course on operator K-theory.
