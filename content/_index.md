I am Xuanrui Qi (亓璇睿), a third-year PhD student at the [Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/).
I am advised by Professors [Jacques Garrigue](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/) and [Lars Hesselholt](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~larsh/).
Broadly speaking, my research interests are in type theory and topos theory, and particularly in connection to geometry and topology.

I hold two master's degrees: a MS in mathematics from Nagoya University (2021), and a MS in computer science from [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/)
in the United States (2019). I did my undegraduate studies at, and received my bachelor's degree in computer science and international relations from Tufts University
in 2018.

You can find a copy of my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

### Research

My research interests could be broadly categorized as type theory and topos theory. Currently, I am mostly interested in
[homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) (HoTT) and &infin;-topos theory, and in particular the use of
modal HoTT as a language for developing geometry and topology, most importantly algebraic geometry, internally to an &infin;-topos.

I am also interested in various related areas:
* abstract approaches to non-commutative geometry;
* categorical foundations of quantum information;
* categorical logic in general;
* the design and implementation of proof assistants;
* formalized mathematics;
* applied algebraic topology and in particular persistence theory.

Previously I also did research in various areas in theoretical computer science, such as design and implementation of type systems.
I was involved in the formalization of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)'s type system.

### Trivia

I have an Erdős number of at most 5.
