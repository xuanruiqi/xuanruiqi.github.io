        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The results of 2022 JSPS DC1 fellowship applications just came out today. Unsurprisingly, I was not selected for the fellowship, but
on the bright side, my reviews were much better than what I had expected. I received a classification of &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; (which means I was in
the top 20% of all unsuccessful applicants), and my T-score (Tスコア) was 3.230, which means that I was ranked approximately
in the top 35% of all applicants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
